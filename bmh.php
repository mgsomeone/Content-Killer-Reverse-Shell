<h3>Greetings, the world!</h3>
There is no ROHINGYA.<br> It is a term invented by the illegal emigrants who came to Arakan from Bangladesh,also known to the world as "boat people".<br> They breed, they multiply rapidly, and then they start insulting, attacking, murdering the original ethnic Arakhan people who lived there peacefully.<br> They disregard our national citizenship policy of 1982. <br>They got training from Islamic city states to carry out terrorist attacks in Arakhan and they are being backed by the international islamic organizations such as OIC.<br> They keep provoking the peaceful Arakhan people, they kill our native Arakhan people with their huge population.<br> And now they are demanding to take Arakhan as their Islamic country state. <br><br>

With the financial support from said groups, they corrupt the media organizations,<br> and they tell the world that they are being massacred, which couldn't be further from the truth.<br> They portray themselves as victims, when in reality their atrocious activities are striking terror in the Arakhan people.<br><br>

We will never accept them as one of our ethnics, simply because they came illegally,<br> they killed our people, they took our land, they burned our houses, and they made peaceful native Arakhan people from deserting their houses to run for their lives. <br>Such atrocious acts will never be accepted, not in Myanmar, not in any country of the world. <br><br>

We beg the world not to be blinded by the corrupted media and see the truth in the web of lies so called Rohingya.<br><br>

<span style="color:red">We Hope you can figure out what the real situation in Myanmar is.</span><br><br>
<div id="longmessage"><br>
<h1>A lie goes around the world while the truth is lacing up its boots</h1>
Dear World, Please listen to our voice with all your heart. Please do not turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to the sorrowful and neglected truth.  <br>
First of all we would like you to know that this is not just a post or explanation but pleading you all to hear our cries from bleeding hearts of we patriotic nationals who are concerned about losing homeland and national identity having encountered the destruction of land and buildings, slaughter of locals and obvious means of attempts for modern colonization of terrorists. 
<h1>Crisis in Rakhine State, Western Myanmar does not relate to a single race, religion or indigenous group but represent all backgrounds and religions.</h1>
Dear fake media, why do you keep shouting “Save Rohingya” without knowing its meaning? It means “a person who returned from Rakhine State”. If so, everyone returned from Rakhine state can be Rohingya. If you come from Spain, you’ll be “a spaingya”. It is not the name of a race, nationality or place but a word that describes to those who had once migrated to Rakhine State taken by British Government from Bangladesh. Under British rule, Bengali labors were carried to our land as they could be cheaply hired for agricultural sector. We confirmed more than million times there isn’t any race or ethnic groups called Rohingyas. <br>
Then, who are the people making crisis, destroying the land, buildings and people of Rakhine? Undoubtedly, they are insurgents and illegal invaders, a group of Bengali terrorists demanding our land with the intention of making new Islamic State. 
<h1>Please come and seek truth in our world being threatened by Bengali insurgents in Western Myanmar </h1>
<h1>(Rakhine State). Did you know what they have done to us?</h1>
Did you all know that -
<ul>
	<li>
		these Bengali living in Rakhine State put forward a proposal to Islamic Conference held in Pakistan in 1942 to occupy some villages of Rakhine where they live? About 300, 000 Buddhists are man slaughtered, with their homes, villages, pagodas, temples and monasteries burnt down by Bengali Muslims. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Buddhists’ rebuilding of villages and homes are burnt and destroyed again by such Bengalis in 1945? 

	</li>
	<li>
	 they set up Mujahid party and started Mujahedeen Insurgency against the then Burma government in 1946-47? Muslims wanted to eliminate non-Muslims everywhere with the intention of occupying the land to make an Islamic Kingdom-with no other religion or faith tolerated.
	</li>
	<li>
	they declared Jihad on Burma launching a campaign of ethnic cleansing, slaughter and destruction, destroying all the Buddhist villages in Northern Maungdaw in 1948? 

	</li>
	<li>
	they demand Muslim State by issuing the Statement to Muslim conference consisting of (1)   to set Rakhine as independent Muslim State  (2)  to divide Sittwe, the Capital of Rakhine into 2 parts, one of which is to be governed by Myanmar and one by Bengali Muslim (3) to establish armed force composed of 50% Muslims and appoint a muslim man as a minister in the central government  (4) To set Muslims Communities ? 
	</li>
	<li>
	Mujahedeen militant groups keep attacking and killing at times between 1950s and 1960s whereas Burma Army retook territory? 

	</li>
	<li>
	Mujahid rebels plotted to create chaos in Burma and seize Rakhine with the help of Libya and Bangladesh in 1977?

	</li>
	<li>
	Rohingya Liberation Organization distributed many copies of recorded cassette tape urging Bengalis in Maungdaw to drive all non-muslims out of the District in 1985 calling for genocide of Buddhists and other non-muslims?

	</li>
	<li>
	the Rohingya Liberation Organization ( RLO) led 50,000 Bengali Muslims to try to quickly and violently take over the Maungdaw Township by destroying big Buddhist monastery and burning all the Rakhine wards in 1988? But their plan to kill all Rakhine people in such area was stopped by local armed forces.

	</li>
	<li>
	Saudi Arabian Military Chief called on Muslim countries to gather an army to invade Burma and Rescue the “Rohingya” in 1992? 

	</li>
	<li>
	about 120 RSO Mujahideen militants entered Maungdaw Township area to burn homes and set off bombs in 1994? 
	</li>

	<li>
	they deliberately created conflicts and crisis with the same intention of colonizing land by raping and killing a village girl in 2012? Similar conflicts occurred in Meikhtila, in Central Myanmar. Throughout the whole year of 2012, they keep attacking by doing the same things – burning homes and religious places, killing locals, kidnapping unarmed Myanmar military engineers, and making violent fights using swords, sticks and firebombs.

	</li>
	<li>
	local people could not live peacefully due to several attacks at times within Maungdaw region? <br>
	Do you know that what these extremist Bengali terrorists are doing to us recently? <br>
		<ul>
			<li>launched series of organized attacks on police and military outposts in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung 
			</li>
			<li>set fires to houses and carried out attacks with small guns and small mines and some mines damaged vehicles of security forces, and supporting group 
			</li>
			<li>burnt religious buildings and villages, destroyed holy images 
			</li>
			<li>killed an acting village administrator, villagers, killed Hindu families
			</li>
			<li>cut of heads from BUDDHA statues
			</li>
			<li>stabbed innocent infants to death under the nose of their mothers
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h1>Little knowledge is very dangerous. Come and See with your own eyes to find out the truth.</h1>
Seeing the above mentioned summarized facts, we are so surprised that why media keep their mouths tightened to let the world have understanding what is really happening here. The Nobel Prize Winner, our leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi also announced that ARSA is an extremist terrorist group and condemned its killing of security force members and civilians. <br><br>

Dear world, please tell the fake Media why they are only expressing biased and subjective concern for Bengali people? Why didn’t they kindly see from our side? What blocked them to see or hear the truth? Are their mouths by their well-off brothers, supporters of terrorism? Didn’t they all know that their thirst for money can bury the truth, which can kill the reputation of a country? <br><br>

Did we invade their land and kill them, or they tried to occupy our land and killed our people? Please think about it carefully. You can’t neglect our people and children get slaughtered, our holy places destroyed, villages burnt down and our national identity insulted. Tell us who actually is to be condemned? Why are we being pointed at by your fingers? Whey we are told to be cruel? How come we have been wrongly condemned? Why is crocodile tear of the actual terrorists so powerful? <br><br>
We are victims – we’ll say repeatedly to prove the truth. We are victims of terrorism. Please have some humanity and sympathy. <br><br>
Don’t we have the right to defend our people, our children and our land? Biting the hands that feed them <br><br>
Dear world, we won’t touch anyone as long as they don’t punch first. We invite or pull no one in our country by force. If other migrants don’t like our rules and don’t like our people, don’t stay in Myanmar. As simple as that!<br><br>
We don’t hate any religion, any race or any ethnic group. We just hate terrorism and terrorists. What we want to eliminate is terrorism and terrorists, not to a single person, or group or race.  We all have law abiding nationalities who are living peacefully to one another whether Buddhist, Christianity, Muslim, Hindu, Sik or any other else. We all respect them. The conflicts do not represent religion or race. <br><br>
Dear World, please don’t get blinded by terrorists who have obvious intensions of modern colonization. Please open your eyes to see the truth. Please don’t watch and staying silent when innocent people are killed by Bengali terrorists. 
<h1>If you still feel pity to terrorists, we are happy to send them to your homeland.
</h1>
Those who encouraged, supported and helped them, or stand by their side shall be regarded as terrorists. <br>
Dear World, Stand for the truth. Otherwise, it will be so unfair and injustice if lands are occupied by non- relevant invaders. <br>
